Various Ports for ZOOTR

Note: I'm lacking a lot of credits due to being a midi horder and not knowing where I got many of the midis from, i'm still searching and filling in the blanks but it's going to take a while, if you know please leave it as an issue on the github and i'll fix it right away. A lot of them are probably from https://www.vgmusic.com/ if you want to help look at all.

	Notes: Trying to find where this remix came from has taken me years and i'm not even 	sure if Levitri is the creator of the midi or just did a cover of it, so i'm linking 	that video and the place I originally found the midi in 2010ish.
